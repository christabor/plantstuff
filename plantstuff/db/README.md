# Plant Database schema [WIP]

## Goals

### DB-agnostic approach

* Document database (e.g. Mongo, Cassandra)
* Graph database/service (e.g. Neo4j, GRAKN)

### Supports a wide variety of applications

Design oriented, like:

* Landscaping
* Gardening

Science oriented, like:

* Botany
* Horticulture

### Allows answering the following questions

A database should provide the ability to generate insights. As such, the ability to answer the following questions is paramount:
