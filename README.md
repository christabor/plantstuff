## DISCLAIMER

This repo is a work-in-progress. The ultimate goals are not yet defined, so everything is still very messy and NOT production ready in any capactiy (whatever that means here).

## LEGAL COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER

No scraped data is stored here until content copyright is verified.

## Scraping spiders

The following scrapy spiders have been created and have been tested to generate real uniform data. All spiders are under `scraping.scrapers.spiders`:

* theplantlist
* springhillnursery
* provenwinners
* wikipedia (basic categorical lists for now)

**Note**: unless otherwise noted, these are not considered exhaustive - but they typically do retrieve most all urls and handle pagination.

### Works in progress

* Monrovia
* Perennials.com
* Plantlust
